module WasmToBetterWasmTests

// TODO: This really need to be done, otherwise we're skipping a stage in the WasmToCommonRegisterMachineTests.
//       It would require a test-framework serialisation format for the Better Wasm data models.
//       The WasmToSerialised.fs file (see FsWasmLibraryTests) has code that could be broken out and shared for this.
